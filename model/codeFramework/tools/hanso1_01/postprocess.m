function [loc, Y, G, w] = postprocess(x, g, dnorm, Y, G, w, options, f)
% postprocessing of set of sampled or bundled gradients
% if x is not one of the columns of Y, prepend it to Y and
% g to G and recompute w and dnorm: this can only reduce dnorm
% also set loc.dnorm to dnorm and loc.evaldist to the
% max distance from x to columns of Y
% note: w is needed as input argument for the case that w is not
% recomputed but is just passed back to output
% options and f are needed only for printing
