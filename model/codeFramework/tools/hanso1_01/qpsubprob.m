function [w,d] = qpsubprob(S, options)
%  solve the gradient sampling QP subproblem 
%     min          w'S'Sw = ||S w||^2
%     w 
%
%     subject to   e'w = 1          Sw is a convex combination of gradients
%                   w >= 0          in the columns of S
%  Return w and d = -Sw.
%
%  The QP is solved by a call to quadprog which will invoke either the 
%  Matlab Optimization Toolbox or MOSEK software, depending on which is
%  installed and, if both are, their relative order in the Matlab Path.  
%  Generally, MOSEK is preferable.  To select it, use "addpath" to
%  add it to the front of the path.  To see which is in use, use "which".
